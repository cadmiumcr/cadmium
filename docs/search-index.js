crystal_doc_search_index_callback({"repository_name":"github.com/watzon/cadmium","body":"![Logo](img/cadmium.png)\n\n[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/watzon/cadmium.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/watzon/cadmium) <a href=\"https://patreon.com/watzon\"><img src=\"https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fshieldsio-patreon.herokuapp.com%2Fwatzon%2Fpledgesssss&style=flat\" /></a>\n\nCadmium is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library for Crystal. Included are classes and modules for tokenizing, inflecting, stemming, and creating n-grams with much more to come.\n\nIt's still in early development, but tests are being written as I go so hopefully it will be somewhat stable.\n\nThis library is heavily based on the [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) library for node.js, and as such you can expect the API's to be very similar. As a point of fact, most of the specs for Cadmium were copied directly from natural and lightly modified.\n\nAny utilities that can be internationalized will be eventually. For now English is the primary concern.\n\nFor full API documentation check out [the docs](https://watzon.github.io/cadmium/).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Tokenizers](#tokenizers)\n- [String Distance](#string-distance)\n- [Stemmers](#stemmers)\n- [Phonetics](#phonetics)\n- [Inflectors](#inflectors)\n- [N-Grams](#n-grams)\n- [Classifiers](#classifiers)\n- [tf-idf](#tf-idf)\n- [Transliterator](#transliterator)\n- [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)\n- [Tries](#tries)\n- [EdgeWeightedDigraph](#edge-weighted-digraph)\n- [Readability](#readability)\n- [WordNet](#wordnet)\n- [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this to your application's `shard.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  cadmium:\n    github: watzon/cadmium\n    branch: master\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRequire the cadmium library in your project\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"cadmium\"\n```\n\n### Tokenizers\n\nCadmium includes several different tokenizers, each of which is useful for different applications.\n\n#### Aggressive Tokenizer\n\nThe aggressive tokenizer currently has localization available for English (:en / nil), Spanish (:es), Persian (:fa), French (:fr), Indonesian (:id), Dutch (:nl), Norwegian (:no), Polish (:pl), Portuguese (:pt), Russian (:ru), and Swedish (:sv). If no language is included it will default to English.\n\nUse it like so:\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium.aggressive_tokenizer.new(lang: :es)\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"hola yo me llamo eduardo y esudié ingeniería\")\n# => [\"hola\", \"yo\", \"me\", \"llamo\", \"eduardo\", \"y\", \"esudié\", \"ingeniería\"]\n``` \n\n#### Case Tokenizer\n\nThe case tokenizer doesn't rely on Regex and as such should be pretty fast. It should also work on an international basis fairly easily.\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium.case_tokenizer.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"these are strings\")\n# => [\"these\", \"are\", \"strings\"]\n\ntokenizer = Cadmium.case_tokenizer.new(preserve_apostrophes: true)\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"Affectueusement surnommé « Gabo » dans toute l'Amérique latine\")\n# => [\"Affectueusement\", \"surnommé\", \"Gabo\", \"dans\", \"toute\", \"l\", \"Amérique\", \"latine\"]\n```\n\n#### Regex Tokenizer\n\nThe whitespace tokenizer, word punctuation tokenizer, and word tokenizer all extend the regex tokenizer. It uses Regex to match on the correct values.\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium.word_punctuation_tokenizer.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"my dog hasn't any fleas.\")\n# => [\"my\", \"dog\", \"hasn\", \"'\", \"t\", \"any\", \"fleas\", \".\"]\n```\n\n#### Treebank Word Tokenizer\n\nThe treebank tokenizer uses regular expressions to tokenize text as in Penn Treebank. This implementation is a port of the tokenizer sed script written by Robert McIntyre. To read about treebanks you can visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank).\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium.treebank_word_tokenizer.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"If we 'all' can't go. I'll stay home.\")\n# => [\"If\", \"we\", \"'all\", \"'\", \"ca\", \"n't\", \"go.\", \"I\", \"'ll\", \"stay\", \"home\", \".\"]\n```\n\n#### Pragmatic Tokenizer\n\nThe pragmatic tokenizer is based off of the ruby gem from diasks2 which you can find [here](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_tokenizer). It is a multilengual tokenizer which provides a wide array of options for tokenizing strings. For complete documentation check [here](https://watzon.github.io/cadmium/Cadmium/Tokenizer/Pragmatic.html).\n\nExample is taken directly from the diasks2/pragmatic_tokenizer documentation, with a few modifications. Currently supported languages are:\n- English (:en)\n- Deutsch (:de)\n\n```crystal\ntext = \"\\\"I said, 'what're you? Crazy?'\\\" said Sandowsky. \\\"I can't afford to do that.\\\"\"\n\nCadmium.pragmatic_tokenizer.new.tokenize(text)\n# => [\"\\\"\", \"i\", \"said\", \",\", \"'\", \"what're\", \"you\", \"?\", \"crazy\", \"?\", \"'\", \"\\\"\", \"said\", \"sandowsky\", \".\", \"\\\"\", \"i\", \"can't\", \"afford\", \"to\", \"do\", \"that\", \".\", \"\\\"\"]\n\n# You can pass many different options to #initialize:\noptions = {\n  language:            :en, # the language of the string you are tokenizing\n  abbreviations:       Set{\"a.b\", \"a\"}, # a user-supplied array of abbreviations (downcased with ending period removed)\n  stop_words:          Set{\"is\", \"the\"}, # a user-supplied array of stop words (downcased)\n  remove_stop_words:   true, # remove stop words\n  contractions:        { \"i'm\" => \"i am\" }, # a user-supplied hash of contractions (key is the contracted form; value is the expanded form - both the key and value should be downcased)\n  expand_contractions: true, # (i.e. [\"isn't\"] will change to two tokens [\"is\", \"not\"])\n  filter_languages:    [:en, :de], # process abbreviations, contractions and stop words for this array of languages\n  punctuation:         :none, # see below for more details\n  numbers:             :none, # see below for more details\n  remove_emoji:        true, # remove any emoji tokens\n  remove_urls:         true, # remove any urls\n  remove_emails:       true, # remove any emails\n  remove_domains:      true, # remove any domains\n  hashtags:            :keep_and_clean, # remove the hastag prefix\n  mentions:            :keep_and_clean, # remove the @ prefix\n  clean:               true, # remove some special characters\n  classic_filter:      true, # removes dots from acronyms and 's from the end of tokens\n  downcase:            false, # do not downcase tokens\n  minimum_length:      3, # remove any tokens less than 3 characters\n  long_word_split:     10 # split tokens longer than 10 characters at hypens or underscores\n}\n```\n\n### String Distance\n\nCorundum provides an implimentation of two different string distance algorithms, the [Jaro-Winkler Distance Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) and the [Levenshtein Distance Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).\n\n#### Jaro-Winkler\n\nThe Jaro-Winkler algorithm returns a number between 0 and 1 which tells how closely two strings match (1 being perfect and 0 being not at all).\n\n```crystal\njwd = Cadmium.jaro_winkler.new\n\njwd.distance(\"dixon\",\"dicksonx\")\n# => 0.8133333333333332\n\njwd.distance(\"same\",\"same\")\n# => 1\n\njwd.distance(\"not\",\"same\")\n# => 0.0\n```\n\n#### Levenshtein\n\nThe Levenshtein distance algorithm returns the number of edits (insertions, modifications, or deletions) required to transform one string into another.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium.levenshtein.distance(\"doctor\", \"doktor\")\n# => 1\n\nCadmium.levenshtein.distance(\"doctor\", \"doctor\")\n# => 0\n\nCadmium.levenshtein.distance(\"flad\", \"flaten\")\n# => 3\n```\n\n#### Pair\n\nPair Distance uses arbitrary n-grams to calculate how similar one string is to another. By calculating the bi-grams for a string, the pair distance algorithm first checks how many occurrences of each bi-gram occur in both strings, then it calculates their similarity with the formula `simularity = (2 · intersections) / (s1size + s2size)`.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium.pair_distance.distance(\"night\", \"nacht\")\n# => 0.25\n```\n\n### Stemmers\n\nCurrently Cadmium only comes with a [Porter](http://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/index.html) Stemmer, but [Lancaster](http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/) will be added soon. Stemmer methods `stem` and `tokenize_and_stem` have also been added to the String class to simplify use.\n\n```crystal\n\"words\".stem\n# => word\n\n\"i am waking up to the sounds of chainsaws\".tokenize_and_stem\n# => [\"wake\", \"sound\", \"chainsaw\"]\n```\n\n### Phonetics\n\nPhonetic matching (sounds-like) matching can be done with the SoundEx or Metaphone algorithms\n\n```crystal\nsound_ex = Cadmium.sound_ex\nmetaphone = Cadmium.metaphone\n\nsound_ex.process(\"phonetics\")\n# => \"P532\"\n\nsound_ex.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\")\n# => [\"R100\", \"A530\", \"G300\", \"C234\"]\n\n# Keep word stops\nsound_ex.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\", true)\n# => [\"R100\", \"A530\", \"G300\", \"N352\", \"O000\", \"C234\"]\n\nsound_ex.compare(\"phonetix\", \"phonetics\")\n# => true\n\nmetaphone.process(\"phonetics\")\n# => \"FNTKS\"\n\nmetaphone.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\")\n# => [\"RB\", \"ANT\", \"KT\", \"KRSTL\"]\n\n# Keep word stops\nmetaphone.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\", true)\n# => [\"RB\", \"ANT\", \"KT\", \"N0NK\", \"ON\", \"KRSTL\"]\n\nmetaphone.compare(\"phonetix\", \"phonetics\")\n# => true\n```\n\nBoth classes can also be used with attached String methods. The default class for String methods is `Metaphone`. The attached methods are `phonetics`, `sounds_like`, and `tokenize_and_phoneticize`.\n\n```crystal\n\"Crystal\".phonetics\n# => \"KRSTL\"\n\n\"Crystal\".sounds_like(\"Krystal\")\n# => true\n\n\"Crystal\".phonetics(nil, Cadmium::SoundEx)\n# => \"C234\"\n\n# Using a max length\n\"Constitution\".phonetics(6, Cadmium::SoundEx)\n# => \"C52333\"\n```\n\n### Inflectors\n\n#### Nouns\n\nNouns can be inflected using the `NounInflector` which has also been attached to the `String` class.\n\n```crystal\ninflector = Cadmium.noun_inflector.new\n\ninflector.pluralize(\"radius\")\n# => radii\n\ninflector.singularize(\"radii\")\n# => radius\n\n\"person\".pluralize\n# => people\n\n\"people\".singularize\n# => person\n```\n\n#### Present Tense Verbs\n\nPresent tense verbs can be inflected with the `PresentVerbInflector`. This has also been attached to the string class.\n\n```crystal\ninflector = Cadmium.present_verb_inflector.new\n\ninflector.singularize(\"become\")\n# => became\n\ninflector.pluralize(\"became\")\n# => become\n\n\"walk\".singularize(false) # noun: false\n# => walks\n\n\"walks\".pluralize(false)  # noun: false\n# => walk\n```\n\n#### Numbers\n\nNumbers can be inflected with the `CountInflector` which also adds a method `to_nth` to the `Int` class.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium.count_inflector.nth(1)\n# => 1st\n\nCadmium.count_inflector.nth(111)\n# => 111th\n\n153.to_nth\n# => 153rd\n```\n\n### N-Grams\n\nN-Grams can be obtained for Arrays of Strings, or with single Strings (which will first be tokenized).\n\n#### bigrams\n\n```crystal\nngrams = Cadmium.ngrams.new\nngrams.bigrams(\"these are some words\")\n# => [[\"these\", \"are\"], [\"are\", \"some\"], [\"some\", \"words\"]]\n```\n\n#### trigrams\n\n```crystal\nngrams = Cadmium.ngrams.new\nngrams.trigrams(\"these are some words\")\n# => [[\"these\", \"are\", \"some\"], [\"are\", \"some\", \"words\"]]\n```\n\n#### arbitrary n-grams\n\n```crystal\nngrams = Cadmium.ngrams.new\nngrams.ngrams(\"some other words here for you\", 4)\n# => [[\"some\", \"other\", \"words\", \"here\"], [\"other\", \"words\", \"here\", \"for\"], [\"words\", \"here\", \"for\", \"you\"]]\n```\n\n#### padding\n\nn-grams can also be returned with left or right padding by passing a start and/or end symbol to the bigrams, trigrams or ngrams.\n\n```crystal\nngrams = Cadmium.ngrams.new\nngrams.ngrams(\"these are some words\", 4, \"[start]\", \"[end]\")\n# => [\n      [\"[start]\", \"[start]\", \"[start]\", \"these\"],\n      [\"[start]\", \"[start]\", \"these\", \"are\"],\n      [\"[start]\", \"these\", \"are\", \"some\"],\n      [\"these\", \"are\", \"some\", \"words\"],\n      [\"are\", \"some\", \"words\", \"[end]\"],\n      [\"some\", \"words\", \"[end]\", \"[end]\"],\n      [\"words\", \"[end]\", \"[end]\", \"[end]\"]\n    ]\n```\n\n### Classifiers\n\nCadmium comes with one classifier so far, a Classic Bayes classifier. It is a probabalistic classifier that, when trained with a data set, can classify words according to categories.\n\n```crystal\nclassifier = Cadmium.bayes_classifier.new\n\nclassifier.train(\"crystal is an awesome programming language\", \"programming\")\nclassifier.train(\"ruby is nice, but not as fast as crystal\", \"programming\")\n\nclassifier.train(\"my wife and I went to the beach\", \"off-topic\")\nclassifier.train(\"my dog likes to go outside and play\", \"off-topic\")\n\nclassifier.categorize(\"Crystal is my favorite!\")\n# => \"programming\"\n```\n\n### tf-idf\n\n[Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is implemented to determine how important a word (or words) is to a document relative to a corpus. The following example will add four documents to a corpus and determine the weight of the word \"crystal\" and then the weight of the word \"ruby\" in each document.\n\n```crystal\ntfidf = Cadmium.tf_idf.new\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about crystal.\")\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about ruby.\")\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about ruby and crystal.\")\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about crystal. it has crystal examples\")\n\nputs \"crystal --------------------------------\"\ntfidf.tfidfs(\"crystal\") do |i, measure, key|\n  puts \"document ##{i} is #{measure}\"\nend\n\nputs \"ruby --------------------------------\"\ntfidf.tfidfs(\"ruby\") do |i, measure, key|\n  puts \"document ##{i} is #{measure}\"\nend\n\n# =>  crystal --------------------------------\n      document #0 is 1\n      document #1 is 0\n      document #2 is 1\n      document #3 is 2\n      ruby --------------------------------\n      document #0 is 0\n      document #1 is 1.2876820724517808\n      document #2 is 1.2876820724517808\n      document #3 is 0\n```\n\n### Transliterator\n\nThe Transliterator module provides the ability to transliterate UTF-8 strings into pure ASCII so that they can be safely displayed in URL slugs or file names.\n\n```crystal\ntransliterator = Cadmium.transliterator\n\ntransliterator.transliterate(\"Привет\")\n# => \"Privet\"\n\ntransliterator.transliterate(\"你好朋友\")\n# => \"Ni Hao Peng You\"\n\n# With the string extension\n\n\"މިއަދަކީ ހދ ރީތި ދވހކވ\".transliterate\n# => \"mi'adhakee hdh reethi dhvhkv\"\n\n\"こんにちは、友人\".transliterate\n# => konnichiwa, You Ren\n```\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\nThe Sentiment module uses the [AFINN-165](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) wordlist and [Emoji Sentiment Ranking](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144296) to provide sentiment analysis on arbitrary blocks of text.\n\n```crystal\nsentiment = Cadmium.sentiment\n\n\"Crystal is seriously the best programming language.\".sentiment\n# or\nsentiment.analyze(\"Crystal is seriously the best programming language.\")\n# =>  {\n        score: 3,\n        comparative: 0,\n        tokens: [\"Crystal\", \"is\", \"seriously\", \"the\", \"best\", \"programming\", \"language\"],\n        words: [\"best\"],\n        positive: [\"best\"],\n        negative: []\n      }\n\n\"I really hate Python\".is_negative?\n# => true\n\n\"I really 💗 Crystal. It's my favorite.\".is_positive?\n# => true\n```\n\n### Tries\n\nA [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) is a data structure for efficiently storing and retrieving strings with identical prefixes, like \"**mee**t\" and \"**mee**k\".\n\n```crystal\ntrie = Cadmium.trie.new\n\ntrie.add(\"meet\")\ntrie.size\n# => 5\n\ntrie.add(\"meek\")\ntrie.size\n# => 6\n\ntrie.contains?(\"meet\")\n# => true\n\ntrie.find_prefix(\"meeting\")\n# => {\"meet\", \"ing\"}\ntrie.find_prefix(\"meet\")\n# => {\"meet\", \"\"}\ntrie.find_prefix(\"me\")\n# => {nil, \"me\"}\n\ntrie.keys_with_prefix(\"me\")\n# => [\"meet\", \"meek\"]\n\ntrie.add([\"m\", \"me\"])\ntrie.matches_on_path(\"meeting\")\n# => [\"m\", \"me\", \"meet\"]\n```\n\n### Edge Weighted Digraph\n\nEdgeWeightedDigraph represents a digraph, you can add an edge, get the number vertexes, edges, get all edges and use toString to print the Digraph.\n\n```crystal\ndigraph = Cadmium.edge_weighted_digraph.new\n\ndigraph.add(5, 4, 0.35)\ndigraph.add(5, 1, 0.32)\ndigraph.add(1, 3, 0.29)\ndigraph.add(6, 2, 0.40)\ndigraph.add(3, 6, 0.52)\ndigraph.add(6, 4, 0.93)\n\nputs digraph.v # => 7\nputs digraph.e # => 6\n```\n\n### Readability\n\nAnalyze blocks of text and determine, using various algorithms, the readability of the text.\n\n```crystal\ntext = <<-EOF\n    After marriage, the next big event in the couples lives will be their honeymoon. It is a time when the newly weds can get away from relatives and friends to spend some significant time getting to know one another. This time alone together that the couple shares is called the honeymoon. A great gift idea for the married couple would be to give them a surprise tour package. Most women would like to go on a honeymoon.\n    The week or two before the ceremonies would be the best time to schedule a tour because then the budget for this event could be considered. In winter there are more opportunities for the couple to get close to one another because of the cold weather. It is easier to snuggle when the weather is not favorable to outdoor activities. This would afford the couple ample time to know more about themselves during the honeymoon.\n    Honeymoon plans should be discussed with the wife to ensure that the shock is pleasant and not a negative experience to her. It is also a good idea in this case, to ask her probing questions as to where she would like to go. Perhaps you could get a friend or family member to ask her what would be her favorite travel location. That would ensure that you know just what she is looking for.\n    Make sure that the trip is exactly what she wants. Then on the wedding night tell her about the adventure so that the needed accommodations can be made.\nEOF\n\nreport = Cadmium.readability.new(text)\n\nputs report.flesch  # => 71.47176470588238\nputs report.fog     # => 10.721568627450981\nputs report.kincaid # => 7.513725490196077\n```\n\n### WordNet\n\n>> WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. - [https://wordnet.princeton.edu/](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)\n\nThis WordNet implimentation is based almost completely on [doches](https://github.com/doches) ruby library [rwordnet](https://github.com/doches/rwordnet) with some extras thrown in and, of course, backed by the speed and type safety of Crystal. This is experimental and the API may change, but WordNet brings the power of the English (and hopefully other languages in the future) dictionary to your programs.\n\nUsing it is easy with Cadmium's API.\n\n```crystal\n# Lookup a single word with a specific part of speech\nlemma = Cadmium.wordnet.lookup(\"horse\", :n)\nputs lemma.word.capitalize + \" - \" + lemma.pos\nlemma.synsets.each_with_index do |synset, i|\n  puts \"#{i + 1}. #{synset.gloss}\"\nend\n\n# Lookup a single word accross all parts of speech\nlemmas = Cadmium.wordnet.lookup(\"horse\")\nlemmas = lemmas.map { |l| {word: l.word, pos: l.pos, synsets: l.synsets} }\nlemmas.each do |l|\n  word = l[:word].capitalize\n  pos = l[:pos]\n  l[:synsets].each do |s|\n    puts \"#{word} (#{pos}) - #{s.gloss}\"\n  end\nend\n\n\n# Lookup a definition by offset and part of speech\nsynset = Cadmium.wordnet.get(4424418, :n)\nputs \"---------------------------------------------\"\nputs synset.synset_offset\nputs synset.pos\nputs synset.gloss\nputs synset.word_counts\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is all I want to have done before a __v1.0__ release.\n\n- [x] Tokenizers\n  - [x] AggressiveTokenizer\n    - [x] i18n\n  - [x] CaseTokenizer\n  - [x] Pragmatic [?](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_tokenizer)\n  - [x] RegexTokenizer\n  - [x] SentenceTokenizer\n  - [x] TreebankWordTokenizer\n  - [x] WhitespaceTokenizer\n  - [x] WordPunctuationTokenizer\n- [x] String Distance\n  - [x] Levenshein\n    - [ ] Approximate String Matching\n  - [x] JaroWinkler\n- [ ] Stemmers\n  - [x] PorterStemmer\n    - [ ] i18n\n  - [ ] LancasterStemmer\n    - [ ] i18n\n- [ ] Classifiers\n    - [x] Bayes\n    - [ ] Logic Regression \n- [x] Phonetics\n  - [x] SoundEx\n  - [x] Metaphone\n  - [ ] Double Metaphone\n- [x] Inflectors\n  - [x] Count\n  - [x] Noun\n  - [x] Verb\n  - [ ] i18n\n- [x] N-Grams\n- [x] TF-IDF\n- [x] Transliterator\n- [x] Sentiment Analysis\n- [x] Tries\n- [x] EdgeWeightedDigraph\n- [x] Readability\n- [x] WordNet\n- [ ] ShortestPathTree\n- [ ] LongestPathTree\n- [ ] Spellcheck\n- [ ] POS Tagger\n- [ ] Word2Vec\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

tokenizer is based off of the [pragmatic_tokenizer]() ruby gem. It is much more robust than any\nof the other tokenizers, but has more features than you'll need for most use cases.\n\n### Constructor Options\n- **filter_languages** : `Array` - user-supplied array of languages from which that language's stop words, abbreviations and contractions should be used when calculating the resulting tokens\n- **language** : `Symbol | String` - two character ISO 639-1 code; can be a String or symbol (default :en)\n- **expand_contractions** : `Bool` - (default: false)\n- **remove_stop_words** : `Bool` - (default: false)\n- **abbreviations** : `Set(String)` - user-supplied array of abbreviations (each element should be downcased with final period removed)\n- **stop_words** : `Set(String)` - user-supplied array of stop words - array elements should be of the String class\n- **contractions** : `Hash(String, String)` - user-supplied hash of contractions (key is the contracted form; value is the expanded form - both the key and value should be downcased)\n- **punctuation** : `PunctuationOptions` - see description below\n  - `all:` Does not remove any punctuation from the result\n  - `semi:` Removes common punctuation (such as full stops) and does not remove less common punctuation\n  (such as questions marks). This is useful for text alignment as less common punctuation can help\n  identify a sentence (like a fingerprint) while common punctuation (like stop words) should be removed.\n  - `none:` Removes all punctuation from the result\n  - `only:` Removes everything except punctuation. The returned result is an array of only the punctuation.\n- **numbers** : `NumberOptions` - see description below\n  - `all:` Does not remove any numbers from the result\n  - `semi:` Removes tokens that include only digits\n  - `none:` Removes all tokens that include a number from the result (including Roman numerals)\n  - `only:` Removes everything except tokens that include a number\n- **minimum_length** : `Int32` - minimum length of the token in characters\n- **long_word_split** : `Int32` - the specified length to split long words at any hyphen or underscore. 0 = no split (default).\n- **mentions** : `MentionOptions` - what to do with mentions (such as '@watzon')\n  - `remove:` will completely remove it\n  - `keep_and_clean:` will prefix\n  - `keep_original:` don't alter the token at all (default)\n- **hashtags** : `HashtagOptions` - what to do with hashtags (such as '#crystal')\n  - `remove:` will completely remove it,\n  - `keep_and_clean:` will prefix\n  - `keep_original:` don't alter the token at all (default)\n- **downcase** : `Bool` - downcase all tokens (default: true)\n- **clean** : `Bool` - removes some symbols (default: false)\n- **classic_filter** : `Bool` - removes dots from acronyms and 's from the end of tokens. [link](# https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/6_6/filter-descriptions.html#FilterDescriptions-ClassicFilter) (default: false)\n- **remove_emoji** : `Bool` - strip emojis (default: false)\n- **remove_emails** : `Bool` - strip emails (default: false)\n- **remove_urls** : `Bool` - strip urls (default: false)\n- **remove_domains** : `Bool` - strip domains (default: false)\n\n### Examples\n\n```\ntokenizer = Cadmium::Tokenizers::Pragmatic.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"Hello world.\")\n# => [\"hello\", \"world\", \".\"]\n\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"Jan. 2015 was 20% colder than now.

English word patterns to guess the number of syllables. A single\nmodule method is made available, +syllables+, which, when passed an\nEnglish word, will return the number of syllables it estimates are in\nthe word.\n\nEnglish orthography (the representation of spoken sounds as written\nsigns) is not regular. The same spoken sound can be represented in\nmultiple different ways in written English (e.g. rough/cuff), and the\nsame written letters can be pronounced in different ways in different\nwords (e.g. rough/bough).\n\nAs the same series of letters can be pronounced in different ways, it is\nnot possible to write an algorithm which can always guess the number of\nsyllables in an english word correctly. However, it is possible to use\nfrequently recurring patterns in english (such as \"a final -e is usually\nsilent\") to guess with a level of accuracy that is acceptable for\napplications like syllable counting for readability scoring. This module\nimplements such an algorithm.\n\nThis module is inspired by the Perl Lingua::EN::Syllable module.\nHowever, it uses a different (though not larger) set of patterns to\ncompensate for the 'special cases' which arise out of English's\nirregular orthography. A number of extra patterns (particularly for\nderived word forms) means that this module is somewhat more accurate\nthan the Perl original. It also omits a number of patterns found in the\noriginal which seem to me to apply to such a small number of cases, or\nto be of dubious value. Testing the guesses against the Carnegie Mellon\nPronouncing Dictionary, this module guesses right around 90% of the\ntime, as against about 85% of the time for the Perl module. However, the\ndictionary contains a large number of foreign loan words and proper\nnames, and so when the algorithm is tested against 'real world' english,\nits accuracy is a good deal better. Testing against a range of samples,\nit guesses right about 95-97% of the time.","summary":"<p>Uses English word patterns to guess the number of
