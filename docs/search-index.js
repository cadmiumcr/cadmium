Included are classes and modules for tokenizing, inflecting, stemming, and creating n-grams with much more to come.\n\nIt's still in early development, but tests are being written as I go so hopefully it will be somewhat stable.\n\nThis library is heavily based on the [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) library for node.js, and as such you can expect the API's to be very similar. As a point of fact, most of the specs for Cadmium were copied directly from natural and lightly modified.\n\nAny utilities that can be internationalized will be eventually. For now English is the primary concern.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Tokenizers](#tokenizers)\n- [String Distance](#string-distance)\n- [Stemmers](#stemmers)\n- [Phonetics](#phonetics)\n- [Inflectors](#inflectors)\n- [N-Grams](#n-grams)\n- [tf-idf](#tf-idf)\n- [Transliterator](#transliterator)\n- [Sentiment Analysis](#sentiment-analysis)\n- [Tries](#tries)\n- [Readability](#readability)\n- [WordNet](#wordnet)\n- [Roadmap](#roadmap)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [Contributors](#contributors)\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd this to your application's `shard.yml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  cadmium:\n    github: watzon/cadmium\n    branch: master\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nRequire the cadmium library in your project\n\n```crystal\nrequire \"cadmium\"\n```\n\n### Tokenizers\n\nCadmium includes several different tokenizers, each of which is useful for different applications.\n\n#### Aggressive Tokenizer\n\nThe aggressive tokenizer currently has localization available for English (:en / nil), Spanish (:es), Persian (:fa), French (:fr), Indonesian (:id), Dutch (:nl), Norwegian (:no), Polish (:pl), Portuguese (:pt), Russian (:ru), and Swedish (:sv). If no language is included it will default to English.\n\nUse it like so:\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium::Tokenizer::AggressiveTokenizer.new(lang: :es)\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"hola yo me llamo eduardo y esudié ingeniería\")\n# => [\"hola\", \"yo\", \"me\", \"llamo\", \"eduardo\", \"y\", \"esudié\", \"ingeniería\"]\n``` \n\n#### Case Tokenizer\n\nThe case tokenizer doesn't rely on Regex and as such should be pretty fast. It should also work on an international basis fairly easily.\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium::Tokenizer::CaseTokenizer.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"these are strings\")\n# => [\"these\", \"are\", \"strings\"]\n\ntokenizer = Cadmium::Tokenizer::CaseTokenizer.new(preserve_apostrophes: true)\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"Affectueusement surnommé « Gabo » dans toute l'Amérique latine\")\n# => [\"Affectueusement\", \"surnommé\", \"Gabo\", \"dans\", \"toute\", \"l\", \"Amérique\", \"latine\"]\n```\n\n#### Regex Tokenizer\n\nThe whitespace tokenizer, word punctuation tokenizer, and word tokenizer all extend the regex tokenizer. It uses Regex to match on the correct values.\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium::Tokenizer::WordPunctuationTokenizer.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"my dog hasn't any fleas.\")\n# => [\"my\", \"dog\", \"hasn\", \"'\", \"t\", \"any\", \"fleas\", \".\"]\n```\n\n#### Treebank Word Tokenizer\n\nThe treebank tokenizer uses regular expressions to tokenize text as in Penn Treebank. This implementation is a port of the tokenizer sed script written by Robert McIntyre. To read about treebanks you can visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank).\n\n```crystal\ntokenizer = Cadmium::Tokenizer::TreebankWordTokenizer.new\ntokenizer.tokenize(\"If we 'all' can't go. I'll stay home.\")\n# => [\"If\", \"we\", \"'all\", \"'\", \"ca\", \"n't\", \"go.\", \"I\", \"'ll\", \"stay\", \"home\", \".\"]\n```\n\n### String Distance\n\nCorundum provides an implimentation of two different string distance algorithms, the [Jaro-Winkler Distance Algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance) and the [Levenshtein Distance Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).\n\n#### Jaro-Winkler\n\nThe Jaro-Winkler algorithm returns a number between 0 and 1 which tells how closely two strings match (1 being perfect and 0 being not at all).\n\n```crystal\nCadmium.jaro_winkler_distance(\"dixon\",\"dicksonx\")\n# => 0.8133333333333332\n\nCadmium.jaro_winkler_distance(\"same\",\"same\")\n# => 1\n\nCadmium.jaro_winkler_distance(\"not\",\"same\")\n# => 0.0\n```\n\n#### Levenshtein\n\nThe Levenshtein distance algorithm returns the number of edits (insertions, modifications, or deletions) required to transform one string into another.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium.levenshtein_distance(\"doctor\", \"doktor\")\n# => 1\n\nCadmium.levenshtein_distance(\"doctor\", \"doctor\")\n# => 0\n\nCadmium.levenshtein_distance(\"flad\", \"flaten\")\n# => 3\n```\n\n### Stemmers\n\nCurrently Cadmium only comes with a [Porter](http://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/index.html) Stemmer, but [Lancaster](http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/computing/research/stemming/) will be added soon. Stemmer methods `stem` and `tokenize_and_stem` have also been added to the String class to simplify use.\n\n```crystal\n\"words\".stem\n# => word\n\n\"i am waking up to the sounds of chainsaws\".tokenize_and_stem\n# => [\"wake\", \"sound\", \"chainsaw\"]\n```\n\n### Phonetics\n\nPhonetic matching (sounds-like) matching can be done with the SoundEx or Metaphone algorithms\n\n```crystal\nsoundex = Cadmium::Phonetics::SoundEx\nmetaphone = Cadmium::Phonetics::Metaphone\n\nsoundex.process(\"phonetics\")\n# => \"P532\"\n\nsoundex.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\")\n# => [\"R100\", \"A530\", \"G300\", \"C234\"]\n\n# Keep word stops\nsoundex.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\", true)\n# => [\"R100\", \"A530\", \"G300\", \"N352\", \"O000\", \"C234\"]\n\nsoundex.compare(\"phonetix\", \"phonetics\")\n# => true\n\nmetaphone.process(\"phonetics\")\n# => \"FNTKS\"\n\nmetaphone.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\")\n# => [\"RB\", \"ANT\", \"KT\", \"KRSTL\"]\n\n# Keep word stops\nmetaphone.tokenize_and_phoneticize(\"Ruby aint got nothing on Crystal\", true)\n# => [\"RB\", \"ANT\", \"KT\", \"N0NK\", \"ON\", \"KRSTL\"]\n\nmetaphone.compare(\"phonetix\", \"phonetics\")\n# => true\n```\n\nBoth classes can also be used with attached String methods. The default class for String methods is `Metaphone`. The attached methods are `phonetics`, `sounds_like`, and `tokenize_and_phoneticize`.\n\n```crystal\n\"Crystal\".phonetics\n# => \"KRSTL\"\n\n\"Crystal\".sounds_like(\"Krystal\")\n# => true\n\n\"Crystal\".phonetics(nil, Cadmium::Phonetics::SoundEx)\n# => \"C234\"\n\n# Using a max length\n\"Constitution\".phonetics(6, Cadmium::Phonetics::SoundEx)\n# => \"C52333\"\n```\n\n### Inflectors\n\n#### Nouns\n\nNouns can be inflected using the `NounInflector` which has also been attached to the `String` class.\n\n```crystal\ninflector = Cadmium::Inflectors::NounInflector.new\n\ninflector.pluralize(\"radius\")\n# => radii\n\ninflector.singularize(\"radii\")\n# => radius\n\n\"person\".pluralize\n# => people\n\n\"people\".singularize\n# => person\n```\n\n#### Present Tense Verbs\n\nPresent tense verbs can be inflected with the `PresentTenseVerb` inflector. This has also been attached to the string class.\n\n```crystal\ninflector = Cadmium::Inflectors::PresentTenseVerb.new\n\ninflector.singularize(\"become\")\n# => became\n\ninflector.pluralize(\"became\")\n# => become\n\n\"walk\".singularize(false) # noun: false\n# => walks\n\n\"walks\".pluralize(false)  # noun: false\n# => walk\n```\n\n#### Numbers\n\nNumbers can be inflected with the `CountInflector` which also adds a method `to_nth` to the `Int` class.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium::Inflectors::CountInflector.nth(1)\n# => 1st\n\nCadmium::Inflectors::CountInflector.nth(111)\n# => 111th\n\n153.to_nth\n# => 153rd\n```\n\n### N-Grams\n\nN-Grams can be obtained for Arrays of Strings, or with single Strings (which will first be tokenized).\n\n#### bigrams\n\n```crystal\nCadmium::NGrams.bigrams(\"these are some words\")\n# => [[\"these\", \"are\"], [\"are\", \"some\"], [\"some\", \"words\"]]\n```\n\n#### trigrams\n\n```crystal\nCadmium::NGrams.trigrams(\"these are some words\")\n# => [[\"these\", \"are\", \"some\"], [\"are\", \"some\", \"words\"]]\n```\n\n#### arbitrary n-grams\n\n```crystal\nCadmium::NGrams.ngrams(\"some other words here for you\", 4)\n# => [[\"some\", \"other\", \"words\", \"here\"], [\"other\", \"words\", \"here\", \"for\"], [\"words\", \"here\", \"for\", \"you\"]]\n```\n\n#### padding\n\nn-grams can also be returned with left or right padding by passing a start and/or end symbol to the bigrams, trigrams or ngrams.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium::NGrams.ngrams(\"these are some words\", 4, \"[start]\", \"[end]\")\n# => [\n      [\"[start]\", \"[start]\", \"[start]\", \"these\"],\n      [\"[start]\", \"[start]\", \"these\", \"are\"],\n      [\"[start]\", \"these\", \"are\", \"some\"],\n      [\"these\", \"are\", \"some\", \"words\"],\n      [\"are\", \"some\", \"words\", \"[end]\"],\n      [\"some\", \"words\", \"[end]\", \"[end]\"],\n      [\"words\", \"[end]\", \"[end]\", \"[end]\"]\n    ]\n```\n\n### tf-idf\n\n[Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) is implemented to determine how important a word (or words) is to a document relative to a corpus. The following example will add four documents to a corpus and determine the weight of the word \"crystal\" and then the weight of the word \"ruby\" in each document.\n\n```crystal\ntfidf = Cadmium::TfIdf.new\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about crystal.\")\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about ruby.\")\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about ruby and crystal.\")\ntfidf.add_document(\"this document is about crystal. it has crystal examples\")\n\nputs \"crystal --------------------------------\"\ntfidf.tfidfs(\"crystal\") do |i, measure, key|\n  puts \"document ##{i} is #{measure}\"\nend\n\nputs \"ruby --------------------------------\"\ntfidf.tfidfs(\"ruby\") do |i, measure, key|\n  puts \"document ##{i} is #{measure}\"\nend\n\n# =>  crystal --------------------------------\n      document #0 is 1\n      document #1 is 0\n      document #2 is 1\n      document #3 is 2\n      ruby --------------------------------\n      document #0 is 0\n      document #1 is 1.2876820724517808\n      document #2 is 1.2876820724517808\n      document #3 is 0\n```\n\n### Transliterator\n\nThe Transliterator module provides the ability to transliterate UTF-8 strings into pure ASCII so that they can be safely displayed in URL slugs or file names.\n\n```crystal\nCadmium.transliterate(\"Привет\")\n# => \"Privet\"\n\nCadmium.transliterate(\"你好朋友\")\n# => \"Ni Hao Peng You\"\n\n# With the string extension\n\n\"މިއަދަކީ ހދ ރީތި ދވހކވ\".transliterate\n# => \"mi'adhakee hdh reethi dhvhkv\"\n\n\"こんにちは、友人\".transliterate\n# => konnichiwa, You Ren\n```\n\n### Sentiment Analysis\n\nThe Sentiment module uses the [AFINN-165](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/pubdb/views/publication_details.php?id=6010) wordlist and [Emoji Sentiment Ranking](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144296) to provide sentiment analysis on arbitrary blocks of text.\n\n```crystal\nsentiment = Cadmium::Sentiment\n\n\"Crystal is seriously the best programming language.\".sentiment\n# or\nsentiment.analyze(\"Crystal is seriously the best programming language.\")\n# =>  {\n        score: 3,\n        comparative: 0,\n        tokens: [\"Crystal\", \"is\", \"seriously\", \"the\", \"best\", \"programming\", \"language\"],\n        words: [\"best\"],\n        positive: [\"best\"],\n        negative: []\n      }\n\n\"I really hate Python\".is_negative?\n# => true\n\n\"I really 💗 Crystal. It's my favorite.\".is_positive?\n# => true\n```\n\n### Tries\n\nA [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) is a data structure for efficiently storing and retrieving strings with identical prefixes, like \"**mee**t\" and \"**mee**k\".\n\n```crystal\ntrie = Cadmium::Trie.new\n\ntrie.add(\"meet\")\ntrie.size\n# => 5\n\ntrie.add(\"meek\")\ntrie.size\n# => 6\n\ntrie.contains?(\"meet\")\n# => true\n\ntrie.find_prefix(\"meeting\")\n# => {\"meet\", \"ing\"}\ntrie.find_prefix(\"meet\")\n# => {\"meet\", \"\"}\ntrie.find_prefix(\"me\")\n# => {nil, \"me\"}\n\ntrie.keys_with_prefix(\"me\")\n# => [\"meet\", \"meek\"]\n\ntrie.add([\"m\", \"me\"])\ntrie.matches_on_path(\"meeting\")\n# => [\"m\", \"me\", \"meet\"]\n```\n\n### Readability\n\nAnalyze blocks of text and determine, using various algorithms, the readability of the text.\n\n```crystal\ntext = <<-EOF\n    After marriage, the next big event in the couples lives will be their honeymoon. It is a time when the newly weds can get away from relatives and friends to spend some significant time getting to know one another. This time alone together that the couple shares is called the honeymoon. A great gift idea for the married couple would be to give them a surprise tour package. Most women would like to go on a honeymoon.\n    The week or two before the ceremonies would be the best time to schedule a tour because then the budget for this event could be considered. In winter there are more opportunities for the couple to get close to one another because of the cold weather. It is easier to snuggle when the weather is not favorable to outdoor activities. This would afford the couple ample time to know more about themselves during the honeymoon.\n    Honeymoon plans should be discussed with the wife to ensure that the shock is pleasant and not a negative experience to her. It is also a good idea in this case, to ask her probing questions as to where she would like to go. Perhaps you could get a friend or family member to ask her what would be her favorite travel location. That would ensure that you know just what she is looking for.\n    Make sure that the trip is exactly what she wants. Then on the wedding night tell her about the adventure so that the needed accommodations can be made.\nEOF\n\nreport = Cadmium::Readability.new(text)\n\nputs report.flesch  # => 71.47176470588238\nputs report.fog     # => 10.721568627450981\nputs report.kincaid # => 7.513725490196077\n```\n\n### WordNet\n\n>> WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept. Synsets are interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations. - [https://wordnet.princeton.edu/](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)\n\nThis WordNet implimentation is based almost completely on [doches](https://github.com/doches) ruby library [rwordnet](https://github.com/doches/rwordnet) with some extras thrown in and, of course, backed by the speed and type safety of Crystal. This is experimental and the API may change, but WordNet brings the power of the English (and hopefully other languages in the future) dictionary to your programs.\n\nUsing it is easy with Cadmium's API.\n\n```crystal\n# Lookup a single word and get all parts of speech\nsynsets = Cadmium::WordNet.lookup(\"horse\")\nsynsets.each do |synset|\n  puts \"---------------------------------------------\"\n  puts synset.synset_offset\n  puts synset.pos\n  puts synset.gloss\n  puts synset.word_counts\nend\n\n# Lookup a single word with a specific part of speech\nsynsets = Cadmium::WordNet.lookup(\"horse\", :v) # :v is for verb\nsynsets.each do |synset|\n  puts \"---------------------------------------------\"\n  puts synset.synset_offset\n  puts synset.pos\n  puts synset.gloss\n  puts synset.word_counts\nend\n\n# Lookup a definition by offset and part of speech\nsynset = Cadmium::WordNet.get(4424418, :n) # :n is for noun\nputs \"---------------------------------------------\"\nputs synset.synset_offset\nputs synset.pos\nputs synset.gloss\nputs synset.word_counts\n```\n\n## Roadmap\n\nThis is all I want to have done before a __v1.0__ release.\n\n- [x] Tokenizers\n  - [x] AggressiveTokenizer\n    - [x] i18n\n  - [x] CaseTokenizer\n  - [ ] Pragmatic [?](https://github.com/diasks2/pragmatic_tokenizer)\n  - [x] RegexTokenizer\n  - [x] SentenceTokenizer\n  - [x] TreebankWordTokenizer\n  - [x] WhitespaceTokenizer\n  - [x] WordPunctuationTokenizer\n- [x] String Distance\n  - [x] Levenshein\n    - [ ] Approximate String Matching\n  - [x] JaroWinkler\n- [ ] Stemmers\n  - [x] PorterStemmer\n    - [ ] i18n\n  - [ ] LancasterStemmer\n    - [ ] i18n\n- [ ] Classifiers\n    - [ ] Bayes\n    - [ ] Logic Regression \n- [x] Phonetics\n  - [x] SoundEx\n  - [x] Metaphone\n  - [ ] Double Metaphone\n- [x] Inflectors\n  - [x] Count\n  - [x] Noun\n  - [x] Verb\n  - [ ] i18n\n- [x] N-Grams\n- [x] TF-IDF\n- [x] Transliterator\n- [x] Sentiment Analysis\n- [x] Tries\n- [x] Readability\n- [ ] EdgeWeightedDigraph\n- [ ] ShortestPathTree\n- [ ] LongestPathTree\n- [x] WordNet\n- [ ] Spellcheck\n- [ ] POS Tagger\n\n## Contributing\n\n1.

However, it is possible to use\nfrequently recurring patterns in english (such as \"a final -e is usually\nsilent\") to guess with a level of accuracy that is acceptable for\napplications like syllable counting for readability scoring. This module\nimplements such an algorithm.\n\nThis module is inspired by the Perl Lingua::EN::Syllable module.\nHowever, it uses a different (though not larger) set of patterns to\ncompensate for the 'special cases' which arise out of English's\nirregular orthography. A number of extra patterns (particularly for\nderived word forms) means that this module is somewhat more accurate\nthan the Perl original. It also omits a number of patterns found in the\noriginal which seem to me to apply to such a small number of cases, or\nto be of dubious value. Testing the guesses against the Carnegie Mellon\nPronouncing Dictionary, this module guesses right around 90% of the\ntime, as against about 85% of the time for the Perl module. However, the\ndictionary contains a large number of foreign loan words and proper\nnames, and so when the algorithm is tested against 'real world' english,\nits accuracy is a good deal better. Testing against a range of samples,\nit guesses right about 95-97% of the time.","summary":"<p>Uses English word patterns to guess the number of

return\n\"\\t\" # tab\n\"\\v\" # vertical tab\n```\n\nYou can use a backslash followed by an *u* and four hexadecimal characters to denote a unicode codepoint written:\n\n```\n\"\\u0041\" # == \"A\"\n```\n\nOr you can use curly braces and specify up to six hexadecimal numbers (0 to 10FFFF):\n\n```\n\"\\u{41}\" # == \"A\"\n```\n\nA string can span multiple lines:\n\n```\n\"hello\n      world\" # same as \"hello\\n      world\"\n```\n\nNote that in the above example trailing and leading spaces, as well as newlines,\nend up in the resulting string. To avoid this, you can split a string into multiple lines\nby joining multiple literals with a backslash:\n\n```\n\"hello \" \\\n\"world, \" \\\n\"no newlines\" # same as \"hello world, no newlines\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, a backslash followed by a newline can be inserted inside the string literal:\n\n```\n\"hello \\\n     world, \\\n     no newlines\" # same as \"hello world, no newlines\"\n```\n\nIn this case, leading whitespace is not included in the resulting string.\n\nIf you need to write a string that has many double quotes, parentheses, or similar\ncharacters, you can use alternative literals:\n\n```\n# Supports double quotes and nested parentheses\n%(hello (\"world\")) # same as \"hello (\\\"world\\\")\"\n\n# Supports double quotes and nested brackets\n%[hello [\"world\"]] # same as \"hello [\\\"world\\\"]\"\n\n# Supports double quotes and nested curlies\n%{hello {\"world\"}} # same as \"hello {\\\"world\\\"}\"\n\n# Supports double quotes and nested angles\n%<hello <\"world\">> # same as \"hello <\\\"world\\\">\"\n```\n\nTo create a `String` with embedded expressions, you can use string interpolation:\n\n```\na = 1\nb = 2\n\"sum = #{a + b}\" # \"sum = 3\"\n```\n\nThis ends up invoking `Object#to_s(IO)` on each expression enclosed by `#{...}`.\n\nIf you need to dynamically build a string, use `String#build` or `IO::Memory`.\n\n### Non UTF-8 valid strings\n\nString might end up being conformed of bytes which are an invalid\nbyte sequence according to UTF-8. This can happen if the string is created\nvia one of the constructors that accept bytes, or when getting a string\nfrom `String.build` or `IO::Memory`. No exception will be raised, but\ninvalid byte sequences, when asked as chars, will use the unicode replacement\nchar (value 0xFFFD). For example:\n\n```\n# here 255 is not a valid byte value in the UTF-8 encoding\nstring = String.new(Bytes[255, 97])\nstring.valid_encoding? # => false\n\n# The first char here is the unicode replacement char\nstring.chars # => ['�', 'a']\n```\n\nOne can also create strings with specific byte value in them by\nusing octal and hexadecimal escape sequences:\n\n```\n# Octal escape sequences\n\"\\101\" # # => \"A\"\n\"\\12\"  # # => \"\\n\"\n\"\\1\"   # string with one character with code point 1\n\"\\377\" # string with one byte with value 255\n\n# Hexadecimal escape sequences\n\"\\x41\" # # => \"A\"\n\"\\xFF\" # string with one byte with value 255\n```\n\nThe reason for allowing strings that don't have a valid UTF-8 sequence\nis that the world is full of content that isn't properly encoded,\nand having a program raise an exception or stop because of this\nis not good. It's better if programs are more resilient, but\nshow a replacement character when there's an error in incoming data.","summary":"<p>A <code><a href=\"String.html\">String</a></code> represents an immutable sequence of UTF-8 characters.</p>","class_methods":[],"constructors":[],"instance_methods":[],"macros":[],"types":[]}]}})
